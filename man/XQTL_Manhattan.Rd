\usage{
XQTL_Manhattan(df, cM = FALSE, color_scheme = "KU")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing QTL scan results with columns: chr, pos, Wald_log10p, and optionally cM}

\item{cM}{Logical, whether to use genetic distance (cM) instead of physical distance (Mb) for x-axis}

\item{color_scheme}{Character string specifying the color scheme. Options include: "KU", "UCI", "Stanford",
"Harvard", "MIT", "Berkeley", "McMaster", "McGill", "Oxford", "Cambridge", "NineInchNails"}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing the Manhattan plot with association statistics
}
\description{
Creates a Manhattan plot for XQTL analysis results, showing association statistics across the genome.
This function generates a traditional Manhattan plot with chromosomes arranged along the x-axis and
-log10(p-values) on the y-axis. It supports both physical (Mb) and genetic (cM) distance scales,
and includes multiple color schemes for different institutions.
