\title{XQTL Manhattan 5-panel Plot}
\usage{
XQTL_Manhattan_5panel(df, cM = FALSE, multiple_traits_column = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing QTL scan results with columns: chr, pos, Wald_log10p, and optionally cM}

\item{cM}{Logical, whether to use genetic distance (cM) instead of physical distance (Mb) for x-axis}

\item{multiple_traits_column}{Optional. Character string specifying the column in df that represents different studies/traits. If provided, points will be colored by this column using a standard 8-color palette and a legend will be added.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with five faceted Manhattan plots, one per chromosome
}
\description{
Creates a multi-panel Manhattan plot showing each chromosome separately in its own facet.
This function generates five individual Manhattan plots (one per chromosome) arranged vertically,
making it easier to examine detailed patterns within each chromosome. Each panel shows the same
association statistics but with independent scaling for better visualization of chromosome-specific features.
If multiple_traits_column is provided, points are colored by this column using a standard 8-color palette and a legend is added.
