\title{Plot frequency changes by replicate}
\usage{
XQTL_change_byRep(df, chr, start, stop)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing frequency data with columns: chr, pos, founder, TRT, freq, REP}

\item{chr}{Character string specifying the chromosome to analyze (e.g., "chr2L")}

\item{start}{Integer specifying the start position in base pairs}

\item{stop}{Integer specifying the stop position in base pairs}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with 4 panels (one per founder) showing frequency changes by replicate
}
\description{
Creates a multi-panel plot showing frequency changes across replicates for the top 4 founders.
This function visualizes how allele frequencies change between treatment and control conditions
across different experimental replicates, helping to assess reproducibility and founder-specific
responses to selection.
