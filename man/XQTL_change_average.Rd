\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing frequency data with columns: chr, pos, founder, TRT, freq, REP}

\item{chr}{Character string specifying the chromosome to analyze (e.g., "chr2L")}

\item{start}{Integer specifying the start position in base pairs}

\item{stop}{Integer specifying the stop position in base pairs}

\item{reference_strain}{Optional character string specifying a reference strain to highlight in grey}

\item{filter_low_freq_founders}{Logical, whether to apply transparency to low-frequency founders}

\item{plotSelection}{Logical, whether to plot selection coefficients (s) instead of frequency changes (Δq)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing frequency changes or selection coefficients by position
}
\description{
Creates a line plot showing either frequency changes (Δq) or selection coefficients (s) across a genomic region.
This function visualizes how allele frequencies change between treatment and control conditions, or the
corresponding selection coefficients, for each founder strain across a specified genomic interval.
}
\details{
This function handles low-frequency founders differently depending on the plot type:

\strong{For frequency change plots (plotSelection = FALSE):}
\itemize{
\item Founders with average frequency < 2.5\% across the interval are plotted with reduced transparency (alpha = 0.2)
\item low-frequency founders often cannot change in frequency much, so we don't want to over-emphasize them
}

\strong{For selection coefficient plots (plotSelection = TRUE):}
\itemize{
\item Founders with average frequency < 2.5\% across the interval are completely excluded from the plot
\item Founders with any positions having frequency < 2.5\% are plotted with reduced transparency (alpha = 0.1)
\item This filtering is necessary because the normalization by 2pq can produce very large, potentially meaningless
values of s when the minor allele frequency is small
\item Low-alpha lines are plotted in the background to maintain visual hierarchy
}

Selection coefficients are calculated as s = Δq/(2pq), where Δq is the frequency change and 2pq is the
heterozygosity in the control condition (p=1-q). This normalization can amplify noise when p or q is very small.
